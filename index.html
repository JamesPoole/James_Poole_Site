      <p>Mycroft is the world's first open source voice assistant. I believe that is important for AI to be open source as
        we move forward and become more complex. I take great interest in this project and contribute to it where I can.</p>

      <h4>Intel STEM Projects</h4>
      <p>I spent about a year as an inten in Intel Shannon which covered over two summers (and was broken up with a semester in college).
      In the two summers, the interns take part in what is called the STEM Challenge. This involves being broken into several teams of around
      five people each and the teams are given separate industries to build some kind of an IOT product in the space of about 9 weeks. I got to
      take part in this twice and got the opportunity to create some of the projects that I am most proud of with some great people. I will briefly
      explain the projects here.</p>
      <p><strong>2016 - Industry: Agriculture - Project: Mastitis Detector and Predictor for Dairy Cattle.</strong></p>
      <p>I really enjoyed this project because it was quite an "out of left field" choice of topic. Mastitis is a huge problem for dairy farmers and
      we aimed to create a device that would allow farmers to monitor the health of their herd. By analysing data over a long term, we could even give
      farmers advance warning of deteriorating health allowing preventative actions to be taken before the problem worsened. Key parts of the project were
      that we found that mastitis could be detected by measuring the conductivity of the milk from the udder. This meant we could do the detection with some basic probes
      and build out the smarts with software. The detector used a Genuino 101 (w/ Intel Curie chip). Some pictures can be found <a href="stem.html">here.</a></p>
      <p><strong>2017 - Industry: Fire Safety - Project: Notifire</strong><p>
      <p>This was a completely different project that I think is brilliant in its simplicity. The idea was to create a way to tell the fire brigade directly
      where people are trapped in a large building that is on fire. Currently when the fire brigade arrive to the scene of a fire, their protocol is to fight the
      fire on the ground floor and work upwards retrieving people as they are found. We created a panic button that would be placed in each apartment of a block and
      if the occupants got trapped they would press this button and the fire department would be notified directly. This means the fire fighters now have a plan as to
      where the priority points are in the building. With new emerging drone technology, drones could be sent directly to the window that is known to contain people.
      We created a mesh network of panic buttons that were composed of custom made circuitry and these communicated to a hub that was to be held offsite. This hub is where
      the information is stored and the fire dept can obtain it from. Piccies of the boards are <a href="stem.html">here.</a></p>

      <h4>University of Limerick</h4>
      <h6>This year I finished up my 4 year stint in college, studying Electronic and Computer Engineering. I am thrilled with what I have gotten out of it. Spending time in Limerick has given me the opportunity to meet so many great people, enjoy a relaxed atmosphere and give me the space to expand my thoughts.</h6>
